title: Readings in Distributed Systems
date: 2020-06-15
---
** Fundamentals
- Distributed Computing Economics
- /Implementing Remote Procedure Calls/ (TOCS '84): the seminal paper on making remote calls look like local function calls. (Recent trends seem to admit the fundamental difference between remote and local calls though.)
- FLP Impossibility (JACM '85) TODO
- Lamport clock (CACM '78) TODO
- Vector clock TODO
- Linearizability (TOPLAS '90) TODO
- Tail at Scale TODO
- Consistencies
- CAP TODO
** Replication
- leases TODO
- /Weighted Voting for Replicated Data/ (SOSP '79): quorum system (N < R + W), which means reads and writes always overlap.
- State machine replication TODO
** Consensus, Distributed Txns and Coordination
- Paxos TODO
- Consensus on Transaction Commit TODO
- Viewstamp Replication TODO
- ZooKeeper (ATC'10)
- Raft [@raft]: the Raft consensus algorithm (to be precise, it's a total-order broadcast protocol).
- 2PC TODO
- etcd TODO
- Chord (SIGCOMM '01) TODO
- Chubby (OSDI '06) TODO
- Corfu TODO
** Cluster Management
- /Mesos: A Platform for Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in the Data Center/ (NSDI '11): de-centralized "offer"-based resource management, allowing multiple frameworks using a single RM.
- /Large-scale cluster management at Google with Borg/ (EuroSys '15): an experience paper on how to scale-up an RM and how to better utilize cluster resource (results are interesting).
** Distributed File Systems
- /Scale and Performance in a Distributed File System/ (SOSP '87): aka AFS, with the concept of copy semantics.
- /Frangipani: A Scalable Distributed File System/ (SOSP '97):
- GFS (SOSP '03) TODO
- HDFS, Ceph TODO
- S3 TODO
** Dataflow Systems
- /MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters/ (OSDI '04): /the/ paper for parallel programming in large-scale clusters (compared with HPC-style).
- /Resilient distributed datasets: A fault-tolerant abstraction for in-memory cluster computing/ (NSDI '12): distributed fault-tolerant immutable lineage graph computation engine.
- Snowflake TODO
- Dremel TODO
- Presto TODO
- /Spark SQL: Relational Data Processing in Spark/ (SIGMOD '15): quite similar to DryadLINQ, but compiles dataframe/SQL to Spark's RDD abstraction.
- /F1 Query: Declarative Querying at Scale/ (VLDB '18): unified OLTP/OLAP/ETL query engine from Google, supporting multiple data sources and an extensible UDF server.
- /DryadLINQ: A System for General-Purpose Distributed Data-ParallelComputing Using a High-Level Language/ (OSDI '08): SQL-like DSL(.NET LINQ) for distributed data processing. Interesting language-integration to make distributed computing feel like local data collection manipulation!
- /FlumeJava: Easy, Efficient Data-Parallel Pipelines/ (PLDI '10): a similar dataflow system based on MapReduce at Google.
** Distributed/Cloud Databases
- F1 DB TODO
- MegaStore TODO
- Percolator TODO
- Bigtable (OSDI '06) TODO
- Dynamo (SOSP '07) TODO
- sandra? TODO
- /Spanner: Googleâ€™s Globally Distributed Database/ (OSDI '12): mind-blowing system with a surprising combination of serializability(2PL,2PC), MVCC(TrueTime API), linearizability(Paxos), sharding(Placement Driver) and data model(SQL).
- Eventual consistency TODO
- /Amazon Aurora: Design Considerations for High Throughput Cloud-Native Relational Databases/ (SIGMOD '17): intersting 6-way replication, redolog offloading and failover.
